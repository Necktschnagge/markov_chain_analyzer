# markov_chain_analyzer
MC Analyzer - a tool to calculate edge-reward expects, variances and covariances in discrete time markov chains

## Build statuses:
* Travis CI: Linux : compile with g++, clang : run doxygen and deploy docs : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Necktschnagge/markov_chain_analyzer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Necktschnagge/markov_chain_analyzer)

## Overall Documentation
You may use this documentation to get a quick overview how to use this solution.
You may use the compiled code as a standalone command line tool or the code as header-only library to build up your own application on top.
To use the C++ class and function definitions directly when writing your own code on top of it, see the [Doxymentation of the code](https://necktschnagge.github.io/markov_chain_analyzer/annotated.html) generated by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).



### How to build
To build the command line tool (executable) you may have a look at how it is build on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/Necktschnagge/markov_chain_analyzer). The configuration for Travis can be found in [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Necktschnagge/markov_chain_analyzer/blob/master/.travis.yml). There you can see what packages are needed to build on Linux. You may also use the following explanation to get started.
#### Set-Up
Download (compile and install where necessary) the following tools:
* A C++ Compiler (such as clang, g++ or MSVC++) with full [C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17) support
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/), make sure that CMake is able to find your compiler
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), make sure you compiled boost and that CMake is able to find your boost installation
* [AMGCL](https://github.com/ddemidov/amgcl) Use the link to Github.com in order to clone the repository. first create some diretcory `repos`. Create a subdirectory `amgcl` where you clone AMGCL into. AMGCL is header-only and therefore does not need to be build. Create another subdirectory to `repos`, called `mc_analyzer` where you clone [this repository](https://github.com/Necktschnagge/markov_chain_analyzer) to.

After these steps just move into the directory where the `CMakeLists.txt` is located (`cd /repos/mc_analyer/`). Run `cmake .` to setup a platform-dependent project followed by `cmake --build .` to build the command line tool.

#### Dependencies
* [C++ boost](https://www.boost.org/) (It is necessary to compiler boost, since features like [boost::regex](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html) are used.)
* [AMGCL](https://amgcl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (needed in case you want to build the command line tool)
